          | 1. Parents are not allowed into the classroom unless requested by the teacher.  The instructor is trained to encourage a shy child until  comfortable joining  in the class.   
          br
          | With patience, it usually takes a lesson or two for your child to discover the joy of dance.

          | 2. Siblings should stay in the lobby at all times.  Please keep the noise to a minimum to avoid disrupting the class.  Please bring something for them to quietly play with while waiting, if necessary.

          | 3. No food, pop, or gum chewing in the studio.  We would  like to avoid gum or spills on dance shoes, clothes, floors, or cubbies.  It is important to avoid damage to the studio dance floors as well as the dancer&apos;s shoes.
